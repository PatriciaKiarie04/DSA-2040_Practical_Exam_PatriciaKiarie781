# Data Warehouse Analysis Report

## Overview
This report analyzes the retail sales data stored in our SQLite-based data warehouse, focusing on key business insights derived from our OLAP queries and visualizations. The analysis covers sales transactions, customer behavior, and temporal patterns using a star schema design with SalesFact, CustomerDim, and TimeDim tables.

## Key Findings

### 1. Sales Distribution Analysis
The analysis of sales distribution reveals:
- Temporal patterns through our TimeDim table
- Customer purchase behaviors across different countries
- Transaction value distributions and patterns

### 2. Canada Market Analysis
Our drill-down analysis of the Canadian market shows:
- Monthly sales aggregations using the TimeDim table
- Customer transaction patterns from CustomerDim
- Total and average sales metrics
- Temporal trends in purchasing behavior

Key metrics for Canada:
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.customer_id) as total_customers,
    SUM(s.total_sales) as total_sales,
    AVG(s.total_sales) as avg_sale
FROM SalesFact s
JOIN CustomerDim c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE c.country = 'Canada'
```

### 3. Customer Behavior Analysis
The customer dimension analysis reveals:
- Transaction frequency patterns
- Geographic distribution of customers
- Customer value segmentation based on total_purchases
- Cross-country purchase behavior comparisons

## Data Warehouse Implementation

### Star Schema Design
Our implementation uses a star schema with:

1. **Fact Table (SalesFact)**
   - Granular sales transactions
   - Links to customer and time dimensions
   - Key metrics: quantity, unit_price, total_sales

2. **Customer Dimension (CustomerDim)**
   - Customer demographics and behavior
   - Aggregated purchase metrics
   - Geographic information

3. **Time Dimension (TimeDim)**
   - Date hierarchies (year, month, day)
   - Temporal aggregation support
   - Calendar attributes for seasonal analysis

### OLAP Operations

1. **Roll-up Implementation**
   ```sql
   -- Example of sales roll-up by month
   SELECT 
       t.year,
       t.month,
       SUM(s.total_sales) as monthly_sales
   FROM SalesFact s
   JOIN TimeDim t ON s.date_id = t.date_id
   GROUP BY t.year, t.month
   ORDER BY t.year, t.month;
   ```

2. **Drill-down Capabilities**
   - From country to customer level
   - From yearly to monthly to daily sales
   - From aggregate to individual transactions

## Data Quality Assessment

### Strengths
- Complete customer dimension with transaction counts
- Temporal granularity in TimeDim
- Reliable sales calculations

### Limitations
- One year of historical data
- Limited product categorization
- Basic customer demographics

## Visualization Outputs

1. **Monthly Sales Trends**
   - Created using matplotlib
   - Stored in 'canada_monthly_sales.png'
   - Shows temporal patterns and seasonality

2. **Customer Distribution**
   - Geographic visualization of customer base
   - Transaction frequency patterns
   - Value segmentation visualization

## Recommendations

1. **Data Enhancement**
   - Add product dimension table
   - Include more customer demographics
   - Extend historical data coverage

2. **Analysis Extension**
   - Implement predictive analytics
   - Add cohort analysis capabilities
   - Develop customer lifetime value metrics

3. **Technical Improvements**
   - Add materialized views for common aggregations
   - Implement index optimization
   - Add data quality constraints

## Conclusion
Our data warehouse implementation successfully enables multi-dimensional analysis of retail sales data. The star schema design with SalesFact, CustomerDim, and TimeDim provides a solid foundation for OLAP operations. The visualization capabilities demonstrate clear patterns in sales and customer behavior, particularly in the Canadian market analysis.

## Next Steps
1. Extend the analysis to other key markets
2. Implement automated reporting
3. Develop predictive models using the warehoused data
4. Enhance visualization capabilities
